Android 4.0 TimePicker and TimePickerDialog backported to 2.1  
Requires android-numberpicker: https://github.com/SimonVT/android-numberpicker
Probably has to be built against API level 15  
  
To use this library, it's required that the 4 attributes from android-numberpicker are added to your theme. Check the sample on how to do this.
