Android 4.0 NumberPicker backported to 2.1  
Requires JakeWhartons NineOldAndroids library. It is included as a jar, but also available at: https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids  
Probably has to be built against API level 15  
  
To use this library, it's required that 4 attributes are added to your theme. Check the sample app on how this is done.
